# ISO_Language_Proposal
Language Code standard draft that illustrates hierarchies and similarities.

# Problem
- IETF and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 has a codes like en-US American_English

- ISO 639-2 includes not only individual language codes but also broader language group codes that represent families or groups of related languages. These group codes are used to categorize languages that share a common origin, linguistic features, or historical relationship. For example, consider the Afro-Asiatic language family, which includes languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, and Hausa, among others. ISO 639-2 assigns the language group code "afa" to represent the Afro-Asiatic language family as a whole. Each individual language within this family has its own unique three-letter code, such as "ara" for Arabic, "heb" for Hebrew, "amh" for Amharic, and "hau" for Hausa.
ISO 639-3 - Only has 3 letter for each "dialect".
Algerian Arabic is Arabic - Maghrebi Arabic - Algerian Arabic. ISO 639-3	arq

#### For it I thinking something like - Ar-Mb-Al
 - "Ar" represents Arabic, the main language family or group.
 - "Mb" represents Maghrebi Arabic, the broader dialect group that includes Algerian Arabic.
 - "Al" represents Algerian Arabic, the specific sub-dialect within the Maghrebi Arabic group.

Nothing already exists/proposed standard for it.

## Advantage 

People dealing with ISO code have to learn it. My way achieves what ISO does and is more human friendly, In the sense that it is easy to understand. Read multiple code and relate between them.

I can already sometimes choose “French- Parisian” or “French-Quebecois”.

Sometimes people are organized.

But “French- Parisian” is not very ISO-sy. I mean not programming friendly.

### Who codes for city level dialects

What is the point it suits both use cases and info is there is you want it
